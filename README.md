The Searchcraft MCP Server provides a suite of tools for managing your Searchcraft cluster's Documents, Indexes, Federations, Access Keys, and Analytics. It enables MCP Clients, like Claude Desktop, to be prompted in plain English to perform administrative actions like setting up search indexes, access keys, ingesting documents, viewing analytics, searching indexes, and more.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file at the project's root and fill in the values:

```
# Server Config
USER_AGENT=searchcraft-mcp-server/<project-version>
DEBUG=true
PORT=3100

# Searchcraft Config
ENDPOINT_URL= # The endpoint url of your Searchcraft Cluster
ADMIN_KEY= # The admin key (super user key) of your Searchcraft Cluster
```

[.env sample](.env.example)


### Running the Server

Make sure your environment has the correct version of node selected.
```bash
nvm use
```

Install dependencies with yarn
```bash
yarn
```

Build & Start the server
```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Usage With Claude Desktop

The server must be running in order for Claude Desktop to detect `searchcraft-mcp-server`'s tools.

`searchcraft-mcp-server` uses `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, so in order to connect it to Claude Desktop, we use [mcp-remote ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote).

In your claude desktop config file, add the following:

**claude_desktop_config.json**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "searchcraft": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:<MY-PORT-FROM-ENV>/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The claude desktop config file can be found at `/Users/[My Workspace]]/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. If no file exists here you can create it.

[Claude desktop config example](claude_desktop_config_example.example.json)

### Claude Desktop Node Version

We have experienced that when Claude Desktop runs the command to connect to the MCP server, it can sometimes choose an older version of Node. If older versions of node are installed on your system, this can lead to issues. Ensure that your default Node version on your system is high enough to properly run the server.

## Debugging

To view claude's logs for debugging purposes, use the npm script:
```bash
yarn claude-logs
```

### Inspector Tool

You can view and try out the available tools/prompts/resources using the inspector. While the mcp server is running, you can launch the inspector:

```bash
yarn inspect
```

- Choose Transport Type: Streamable HTTP
- Specify the URL that the server is running on, including the port number.
- Hit "Connect"

```
http://localhost:<MY-PORT-FROM-ENV>/mcp
```

The Inspector allows you to view available tools and to try making test calls to them.
